# lcg_plus

Continuous variable circuit simulator with Gaussian components and photon number resolving detectors. This is an extension of the [bosonic backend](https://strawberryfields.ai/photonics/demos/run_intro_bosonic.html) from strawberryfields with improved photon number resolving detector capabilities.

## Requirements
- See `pyproject.toml`

## Installation
`pip install -e .` from root.

## Features
- Simulation of phase-space Wigner functions in the Gaussian representation.
- Non-Gaussian states and measurements are represented as linear combinations of multivariate Gaussians.

## Tutorials
See Jupyter notebooks in `demos_final/`.
